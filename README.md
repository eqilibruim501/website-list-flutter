# list_tester_app

A new Flutter project which allows you to add your favorite list of Companies with website links that you can visit with a click. The app also lets you add Employee names, Emails and Phone numbers. The list of companies can be previewed with a picture and name and upon a gesture will present a dialogbox to show the details of the company.
